### ChatGPT-4 Message Limit Tracker

[Install the extension here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chatgpt-4-message-limit-t/epehajplcipobcknalgcdneghbegkiai).

Currently, when using OpenAI Plus, the user is limited to X messages in Y hours. At the time of publishing this, X=50 and Y=3.

This Chrome extension adds a simple message to display the amount of messages remaining in that window, and the time until the window resets. 

OpenAI has not published exactly how this limit works, however [some have written that it is not a sliding window](https://drewisdope.com/chatgpt-message-cap/), but rather a window of time that begins at the first message sent and then reset after Y hours have passed. 

This extension is built with that design in mind.
